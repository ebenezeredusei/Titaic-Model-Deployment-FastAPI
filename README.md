# Titaic-Model-Deployment-FastAPI
In this Repository, the titanic data was used to train various models to predict passenger survival. Also, a selected trained model was  wrapped into FastAPI and used in making predictions in real time


# Description
Having analysed the data to identify the relevant columns in the titanic dataset, the features were engineered, and fed to a machine learning model to predict passenger survival. An API was created to interact with a Machine Learning model, that is to say:

Pass data through a request;
Get the data in using the API;
Apply the necessary processing;
Submit the processed data to the ML model to make the predictions;
Process the predictions obtained and return them as the API's response ot the input request.
